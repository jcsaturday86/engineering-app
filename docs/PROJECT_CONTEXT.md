# Project Context

## Overview

The **Engineering Permit Management System (EPMS)** is a web application for the City of San Fernando, La Union, Philippines. It manages the full lifecycle of building and occupancy permits — from application intake through assessment, billing, payment, and permit issuance.

This system replaces the legacy BOPMS (Building and Occupancy Permit Management System). See `docs/BOPMS_*.md` for legacy reference.

## Architecture Decisions

### Service Layer Pattern
Business logic lives in `app/Services/`, controllers are thin. Services handle: application creation/numbering, assessment finalization, billing generation, payment processing, permit generation, fee computation.

### DTOs for Data Transfer
`app/DTOs/` contains readonly classes for type-safe data transfer from requests to services (`ApplicationDTO`, `AssessmentItemDTO`, `CollectionDTO`).

### Action Classes
`app/Actions/` wraps complex multi-step operations: `CreateApplicationAction`, `FinalizeAssessmentAction`, `GeneratePermitAction`. Actions call services, log activity, and handle state transitions.

### Separate BP and OP Tables with Polymorphic Relationships
Building Permit (BP) and Occupancy Permit (OP) applications live in separate database tables: `applications` (BP only) and `occupancy_applications` (OP only). Seven downstream tables (assessments, billings, collections, permits, documents, application_requirements, application_occupancy_groups) use polymorphic columns (`applicationable_type`, `applicationable_id`) to reference either model. A morph map (`bp` → Application, `op` → OccupancyApplication) is registered in `AppServiceProvider`.

### Interface + Trait Pattern for Shared Behavior
`app/Contracts/PermitApplicationContract.php` defines the shared interface. `app/Concerns/HasPermitApplicationBehavior.php` provides a trait with shared accessors and polymorphic relationships (assessments, billings, collections, permits, documents, etc.). Both `Application` and `OccupancyApplication` implement the contract and use the trait, keeping BP-specific logic (scope of work, cost fields, zoning, engineer/PEE/SEW) in `Application` only.

### Enum-Based State Machine
`app/Enums/ApplicationStatus.php` defines the complete workflow with `allowedTransitions()` and `allowedTransitionsFor(string $permitTypeCode)` for strict state validation. BP applications without skip LC go to `for_zoning_assessment` status. OP flow skips zoning entirely. No invalid transitions possible.

### Consolidated Fee Schedule
BOPMS had 100+ individual fee tables. Engineering-app consolidates into 3 tables:
- `fee_categories` — groups by permit type (BP construction fees, OP occupancy fees, etc.)
- `fee_types` — individual fee items with computation method
- `fee_schedules` — rate rows with ranges, fixed fees, excess thresholds

Six computation methods: `fixed`, `per_unit`, `range_based`, `cumulative_range`, `percentage`, `formula`.

### Dedicated Zoning Fee Tables
Zoning fees use dedicated tables matching BOPMS naming:
- `land_use_and_zoning_fees` — locational clearance fees by occupancy sub-group with range-based + excess computation (162 rows across 52 sub-groups, 6 fee patterns)
- `certification_zoning_fees` — flat certification fee (P500)
- `land_use_and_zoning_other_fees` — Variance/Non-Conforming fees

Auto-compute in `ZoningController::autoCompute()` queries these tables directly, matching BOPMS `TransactionController::zoningAutoCompute()` logic.

### BOPMS-Style Assessment Tabs
The BP assessment page (`/assessments/{id}`) uses tabbed navigation with fee category tabs (Construction, Electrical, Mechanical, Plumbing, Electronics, Accessories, Accessory, Surcharges) plus a Summary tab. Each tab has a dedicated form matching the original BOPMS UI:

- **Construction tab** — BOPMS-style form: Part of Building + Division (filtered by occupancy groups) + Area → server-side fee lookup from `fee_schedules` by division code + area range. Formula: `amount = area × fee_per_unit`.
- **Electrical tab** — BOPMS-style form: 7 fee types (TCL, Transformer, UPS/Generator, Pole Location, Guying, Meter, Wiring) with conditional fields. Range-based kVA types use formula: `amount = fixed_fee + (kva × fee_per_unit)`. Fixed types use `amount = fixed_fee`. Inspection fee auto-computed as `amount × percentage` from `assessment.electrical_inspection_percentage` setting (default 10%). Total amount = base fee + inspection fee.
- **Other tabs** — Generic form: select Fee Type, enter Quantity + Unit Fee.

### Self-Healing Service Provider
`SelfHealingServiceProvider` auto-creates database, runs migrations, and seeds roles/settings/admin if missing on every application boot. Ensures the system works even on a fresh install.

### Spatie Permission (RBAC)
9 roles with 30+ granular permissions. Each route protected with `middleware('can:permission-name')`.

### Spatie Activitylog (Audit Trail)
Activity logging on Application, Assessment, Collection, Permit models. Tracks who changed what, when.

## Key Design Principles

- **Thin controllers** — Business logic in services, not controllers
- **Soft deletes** — All transaction tables use soft deletes for audit trail
- **Activity logging** — All major model changes tracked
- **State machine** — Strict workflow validation via enum-based transitions
- **No BFP module** — Fire safety (FSEC/FSIC) is intentionally excluded from this system
- **Separate portals** — Staff login (`/staff/login`) and client login (`/login`) are separate
- **CDN dependencies** — Tailwind CSS and Alpine.js loaded via CDN (no build step)
