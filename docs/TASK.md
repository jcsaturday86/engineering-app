## Completed Tasks

### Separate BP and OP into Different Database Tables — COMPLETED

- `applications` = BP only; new `occupancy_applications` = OP only
- 7 downstream tables use polymorphic `applicationable_type`/`applicationable_id` (morph map: bp/op)
- New `OccupancyApplication` model + `OccupancyApplicationService` + `OccupancyApplicationDTO`
- New `OccupancyApplicationController` + `/occupancy-applications/*` routes + views
- Parallel `*Op()` methods in Assessment/Billing/Collection/Permit controllers
- 4 notification classes accept `Model` instead of `Application`
- `ApplicationStatus::allowedTransitionsFor(string $permitTypeCode)` for OP flow

### Zoning Assessment Fee Auto-Compute & Settings — COMPLETED

- New `land_use_and_zoning_fees` table (162 rows, 52 sub-groups, 6 fee patterns) + `certification_zoning_fees` (P500)
- `ZoningController::autoCompute()` matches BOPMS `zoningAutoCompute()` logic
- New `ZoningFeeController` + `/settings/zoning-fees` accordion settings page
- `land_use_and_zoning_other_fees` table (Variance/Non-Conforming) + settings UI
- New `for_zoning_assessment` status; `submitted` = skip-LC path
- Browser autofill disabled on all forms; `ApplicationSeeder` with 5 BP + 5 OP test records

### Zoning Assessment UX Improvements — COMPLETED

- 4 fee type selector (LC, LC Manual, Certification, Others) matching BOPMS
- Checkbox select-all / bulk delete via fetch API
- Password confirmation modal on finalize (Hash::check())

### BP Assessment Tabbed Navigation & BOPMS-Style Forms — COMPLETED

- 8 fee category tabs + Summary tab with item count badges
- **Construction tab:** Part of Building + Division + Area → server-side fee lookup. `amount = area × fee_per_unit`
- **Electrical tab:** 7 fee types, conditional fields, range kVA: `base = fixed_fee + (kva × fee_per_unit)`. Inspection fee = `base × electrical_inspection_percentage` (setting, 10%). `amount` = base; `inspection_fee` stored separately
- Split `ELEC_TUG` → `ELEC_TRANS` + `ELEC_UPS` matching BOPMS
- New routes: `POST /assessments/{id}/construction-item`, `POST /assessments/{id}/electrical-item`

### Mechanical Fee Assessment with NBC Inspection Fees — COMPLETED

- **MECH_INSP fee category:** 29 `INSP_*` fee types with 55 schedule rows; NBC rates sourced from BOPMS `ann_inspection_f*` SQL tables (I through XIX). Category hidden from assessment tab bar.
- **Mechanical tab (BOPMS-style):** `addMechanicalItem()` computes base permit fee (MECH schedules) + NBC inspection fee (`resolveInspectionFee()` maps `MECH_REFRIG` → `INSP_REFRIG`). `amount` = base only; `inspection_fee` stored separately. Consistent grand total: `sum(amount) + sum(inspection_fee)`
- Three inspection fee formulas: `flat` (range-band fixed_fee ± excess), `per_unit` (rate × unit ± excess), `tiered` (cumulative for elevators: first N floors × rate + excess × rate2)
- Route: `POST /assessments/{id}/mechanical-item`
- `MECH_INSP` added to `$excludedTabs` so it never appears as a manual-entry tab

### Plumbing / Electronics / Accessories / Surcharge Tabs (BOPMS-style) — COMPLETED

- **Plumbing tab:** 22 PLUMB_* fee types grouped (Installation / Fixtures / Special Fixtures / Range-Based), dynamic unit label per fee type. `addPlumbingItem()` handles per_unit and range_based (with excess) methods
- **Electronics tab:** 11 ELECT_* fee types, `addElectronicsItem()`
- **Accessories (ACC_BLDG), Accessory Fees (ACC_FEE), Surcharge (SURCHARGE) tabs** with dedicated add methods and routes
- Routes: `POST /assessments/{id}/plumbing-item`, `electronics-item`, `accessory-item`, `acc-fee-item`, `surcharge-item`

### Assessment Finalization Locking — COMPLETED

- After BP assessment finalize: all add forms hidden, per-row and bulk Remove hidden; server-side `redirectIfFinalized()` guard in every add/remove method redirects to `?tab=SUMMARY` with error
- After zoning finalize: autocompute, add, remove (single + bulk), and Save Details blocked; `ZoningController::abortIfZoningFinalized()` aborts 403; single amber "finalized" banner
- Finalize (BP and OP) redirects back to the Summary tab (`?tab=SUMMARY`) instead of the first tab

### BP Assessment PDF & Print Improvements — COMPLETED

- Fire Code Fees section removed from the printed Summary of Computation; sections renumbered 1–10
- Real Code 128 barcode image (picqer/php-barcode-generator, base64 PNG) rendered above the BP number
- "Approved By" pulled from `signatories` where role = `building_official` (title + name on one line, designation below)
- Print button on BP assessment index when status = `engineering_assessed`

### OP Occupancy Fee Tab (BOPMS-style) — COMPLETED

- `addOccupancyFeeItem()` + route `POST /assessments/op/{op}/occupancy-fee`
- 8 OCC_* fee types; Unit field label switches by type: Costing (₱) / Area (sq.m) / Amount (₱) / Meters-Units
- Server-side computation honors all three occupancy methods:
  - `range_based` with excess: `fixed_fee + ceil(excess / excess_every) × excess_fee` (e.g. "per ₱1M or fraction thereof")
  - `per_unit`: `unit × fee_per_unit`
  - `percentage`: `unit × schedule.percentage` (e.g. J-II 50% of principal rate)
- All 8 divisions verified against seeded schedules (9 samples, subtotal ₱9,250)

## Upcoming Tasks

| Task | Priority | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| Additional permit types (FP, EP, DP, etc.) | Medium | Currently only BP and OP are active |
| Document requirement upload UI | Low | Model/route exists, UI needs improvement |
| Email notification configuration | Low | SMTP settings, notification templates |
| Annual inspection module (non-mech) | Future | Not in current requirements |
